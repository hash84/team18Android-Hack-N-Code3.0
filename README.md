The application detects the presence of waste products and the user is rewarded based on the type and size/quantity of waste.

Rewards in the form of wallet credits are given for putting waste into the trash can or reporting a GeoLocation. 

The geolocation is recorded every time a user clicks an image and successfully claims a reward which ensures no other user claims reward for the same waste
